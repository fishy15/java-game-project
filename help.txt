To begin the game, click on the "Start" button. This will take you to the start of the game. The biggest part of the game page is the board, which is in a checkerboard pattern. Below the board is the alerts box, which will send you status reports on the game. On the right-hand column, there are 3 main components: the Image Viewer, the dice, and the settings. Once the game has started, click on the dice to roll it. After the dice has rolled, you will see the result and a question will pop up. 
There are two types of questions: ones with buttons and ones with a slider. If there are buttons, click on what you think is the best choice and click submit. If there is a slider, move the slider to your choice and then click submit. After submitting your answer, you will see various sections: the top, which tells if your answer was right, the middle, which gives more information, and the bottom, which summarizes how much you will move. Once you close the question, your token (blue token will move). The computer (red) will then move as well. If you roll a 5 or a 6, you will automatically get an extra roll.
After you keep answering questions, you will get closer and closer to 100. If you reach 100 first, you win the game. However, if you don't get there in time or you used up all the questions, you will have to restart the game. If you need help with the questions, you can select an image from the Image Viewer. If you want to look at the image in more detail, you can click on the image to see a pop-up. If you want to change the difficulty level of the game, move the difficulty slider up and down, with 1 as the easiest difficulty and 4 as the hardest.
